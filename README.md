## Project Motivation 
The motivation behind this project is to use CRISP-DM methodology to conduct an analysis on the 2018, 2019, 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data to answer the following questions:
- Does organization size affect the developers’ level of influence on technology purchase? 
- Compare between different countries of organizations and their effect on the developers level of influence on technology purchase
- What are the most popular programming languages in 2020? Compare with the popular languages in large, medium, small and micro size organizations.
- What are the trends of programming languages between 2018 and 2020?

## File Descriptions
There are 1 folder and 4 notebooks here of the analysis conducted to answer the above questions:
Data folder: has the data used in this analysis. The raw data files contained were copied from Stack Overflow website
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/

 - **File1:** Contains the analysis conducted to answer the question: Does organization size affect the developers’ level of influence on technology purchase? 
 - **File2:** Contains the analysis conducted to answer the question: Compare between different countries of organizations and their effect on the developers level of influence on technology purchase
- **File3:** Contains the analysis conducted to answer the question: What are the most popular programming languages in 2020? Compare with the popular languages in large, medium, small and micro size organizations.
- **File 4:** Contains the analysis conducted to answer the question: What are the trends of programming languages between 2018 and 2020?

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here. (medium link)
And here is a summary of the results of the analysis:


- **Organization Size Effect on Developers Level of Influence on Technology Purchase:** More develoeprs working for micro and small organizations have more influence on purchasing new technologies than those working for medium and large organizations.

- **Country of Organization Effect on Developers Level of Influence on Technology Purchase:** More developers in large organizations in India and Canada have great influence on purchasing technology, while more than 66% of the developers in France and Spain said that they have little or no influence. On the other hand, around 42% of the developers in micro size organizations in the US and Netherlands have more influence, while more than 29% of the developers in India and Spain have little or no influence.

- **Popular Programming Languages in 2020:** JavaScript is the most popular language among developers. Python is the most language that is becoming increasingly popular. Developers want to use JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Java, Bash/Shell/PowerShell, PHP much less than they did this year. They also want to use TypeScript, Go, Kotlin and Rust more. PHP is used less than C and C++ in large organizations than in medium and small organizations.

- **Programming Languages Popularity Trends between 2018 and 2020:** Developers have less interest in using JavaScript and more interest in using Python. There seems to be a correlation between what the developers say and do over the past 3years.

## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. There should be no necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.
